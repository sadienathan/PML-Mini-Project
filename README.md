# PML-Mini-Project

This notebook includes the main Mini Project file (called Mini Project), a secondary file that explores the 'most common country' feature, the read me and the project report.
I have experienced difficulties in uploading the data used due to the massive size of the file and because it is so large I can not open the file in Excel to reduce it. 

Here is a link to the original dataset that I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset
