# PML-Mini-Project

This notebook includes the main Mini Project file (called Mini Project), a secondary file that explores the 'most common country' feature, the read me, and the project report.

Due to technical difficulties, I have been unable to upload the dataset in its entirety, and therefore I have reduced it from the 100,000 rows in the data frame to 20,000. I would recommend downloading the original dataset if you are running the code through to produce the same results that I have, but for the sake of uploading this, I have put the 20,000 df in. I do reduce the dataset in the files but I keep the distribution whereas here I have just reduced it.  

Here is a link to the original dataset that I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset
